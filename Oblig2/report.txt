1. What is the time complexity of your solution? You must explain the stated complex-
ity. If you have a different complexity for each problem, you need to discuss them
separately.
  If there is a cycle in graph: 
	O(n^2)
	Program will only use hasCycle() method. hasCycle() takes n time.
	After that hasCycle() will call dfs() method. That in worse case will go for n time. 

  If there is no cycle in graph:
	
	findInfo() > O(n+n+n+n+n^2) = O(n^2)
	simulate() > O(n^shortesttime) = O(n)
	printInfo() > O(n)
	
	So together can we say that whole program have O(n^2) running time




2. What requirements are there for the input graph in order for the project to be suc-
cessfully planned? Please put the discussion in the light of graf theoretical properties.

Input graph must be directed and asyclical.



3. What kind of the graph algorithms did you use in your implementation

DFS and "Detect Cycle in Directed Graph Algorithm"
